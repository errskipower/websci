  Lab 2: APIs


#DETAILS

  For this lab I used the Forecast.io api in jQuery/JS to pull weather information using the browser's current location.  I also used Google Map's Geocode api to get the name of the current location because Forecast.io does not support that.  The app will show an error message if the browser does not have geolocation enabled or if there is an error accessing the api.  If you click the "refresh" button, all weather information will be updated without a page reload.  I used CSS animations/transitions on the box displaying weather info as well as on the "refresh" button.
