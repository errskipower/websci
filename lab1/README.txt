  Lab 1: HTML, CSS3, JS


#DETAILS

  For this lab I used the twitter api with php to pull tweets about "web development" (see sources).  Because the original lab was very easy for me, I added a few things to make it more challenging for myself (twitter api, settings, velocity.js).  Via the Settings, you can reset the total number of tweets collected from 0 - 200 at a step of 5, change the query, and change the result type.
  
 * Note: I'm assuming that trending hashtags were not required for this project as they were not mentioned specifically in the assignment details.

  How to download twitter php api.
  I am already very well-versed in PHP, so most of this was not new to me.  The get-tweets.php was taken from this website and modified slightly for my needs.  I did not use any of the code in the jquery section.
