  Lab 4: Mobile App


#DETAILS

  For this lab, I used jQuery Mobile framework as well as media queries to make my site more responsive.  A loader image pops up when initially loading tweets and when users changes settings.  I also fixed some issues with loading new tweets after adjusting "Settings" and enhances the "Settings" panel to be a popup.

  * See README from Lab #1 for details on the twitter API and how settings work.
